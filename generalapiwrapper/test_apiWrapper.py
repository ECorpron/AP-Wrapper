# I don't think that it is necessary to test getters and setters, which
# are the majority of the methods in apiWrapper. The methods that are not
# getters and setters would require mocking a ping to an api. This is something
# I don't know how to do, and wasn't covered in class. Adding tests for these
# is something that would like to add in the future.
